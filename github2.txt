The project I chose is called "guns on campus" by the Texas Tribune. I chose this project because the Trib is one of my dream news organizations, and I always enjoy the work they do reporting on Texas higher ed. This has also been an issue that's blown up recently, and they've done a good job staying on top of it with new and creative ways. I'd be interested in chatting with the developers about how they decided to differentiate their visual coverage from other national orgs that were covering the same story, how they gained their data, how they decided to highlight and display what was most important, and then how they built the actual visualizations.
